A.Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question
B.Statement 2 alone is sufficient, but Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question
C.Both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question, but neither statement alone is sufficient
D.Each statement alone is sufficient
E.Statements 1 and 2 together are not sufficient, and additional data is needed to answer the question
Ans: b
Explanation:
Given 2G + 3B = 20. Now if we use statement (A) that number of girls is not more than 5, then we have G = 1, B = 6 OR G = 4, B = 4. Since we cannot get a single solution from this statement it is not sufficient to answer the question. If we use statement (B) 3B + 2G = 20 we have G = 4 and B = 4. Hence, statement (B) alone is sufficient to answer the question.

A.The question can be answered by using one of the statements alone, but cannot be answered by using the other statements alone
B.The question can be answered by using either statement alone
C.The question can be answered by using both statements together, but cannot be answered by using either statement alone
D.The question cannot be answered even by using both the statements together
Ans: b
Explanation:
20 60 32 28 12 so the mixture will be in 28:12 ratio => 7:3 ratio (1) if we have 70 liters of 32% alcohol that means we have 70*(7/(7+3)) liter = 49 liter of 20% alcohol (2) if we have 21 liter of 60% alcohol that means 3x = 21(from the ratio) => x = 7 so we have 7 * 7(from ratio) liter of 20% of alcohol so both statement alone is sufficient
