1. In a covering, a certain distance, the speeds of A and B are in the ratio of 3:4. A takes 30 minutes more than B to reach the destination. The time taken by A to reach the destination is?

    1 hour
    1 1/2 hour
    2 hour
    2 1/2 hour

Answer: Option 3

Solution

Ratio of speeds = 3:4
Ratio of times taken = 4:3
Suppose A takes 4x hrs and B takes 3x hrs to reach the destination.
Then, 4x – 3x = 30/60 => x = 1/2
Time taken by A = 4x hrs = 4 * 1/2 = 2 hrs.

2. A train 110 m long is running with a speed of 60 km/hr. At what time will it pass a man who is running at 6 km/hr in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?

    5 sec
    6 sec
    7 sec
    10 sec

Answer: Option 2

Solution

Speed of train relative to man = 60 + 6 = 66 km/hr.
= 66 * 5/18 = 55/3 m/sec.
Time taken to pass the men = 110 * 3/55 = 6 sec.

3. A alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and B alone in 8 days. A and B undertook to do it for Rs. 3200. With the help of C, they completed the work in 3 days. How much is to be paid to C?

    Rs. 375
    Rs. 400
    Rs. 600
    Rs. 800

Answer: Option 2

Solution

C’s 1 day’s work = 1/3 – (1/6 + 1/8) = 1/3 – 7/24 = 1/24
A’s wages : B’s wages : C’s wages
1/6 : 1/8 : 1/24 = 4:3:1
C’s share = 1/8 * 3200 = Rs. 400

4. A, B, and C started a business with capitals of Rs. 8000, Rs. 10000 and Rs. 12000 respectively. At the end of the year, the profit share of B is Rs. 1500. The difference between the profit shares of A and C is?

    Rs. 300
    Rs. 400
    Rs. 500
    Rs. 600
    None of these

Answer: Option 5

Solution

Ratio of investments of A, B and C is 8000 : 10000 : 12000 = 4 : 5 : 6
And also given that, profit share of B is Rs. 1500
=> 5 parts out of 15 parts is Rs. 1500
Now, required difference is 6 – 4 = 2 parts
Required difference = 2/5 (1500) = Rs. 600

5. If Rs. 510 be divided among A, B, C in such a way that A gets 2/3 of what B gets and B gets 1/4 of what C gets, then their shares are respectively?

    Rs. 120, Rs. 240, Rs. 150
    Rs. 60, Rs. 90, Rs. 360
    Rs. 150, Rs. 300, Rs. 60
    None of these

Answer: Option 2

Solution

(A = 2/3 B and B = 1/4 C) = A/B = 2/3 and B/C = 1/4
A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 1:4 = 3:12
A:B:C = 2:3:12
A;s share = 510 * 2/17 = Rs. 60
B’s share = 510 * 3/17 = Rs. 90
C’s share = 510 * 12/17 = Rs. 360.

6. The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then find the speed of the boat in still water?

    10 kmph
    21 kmph
    8 kmph
    12 kmph

Answer: Option 3

Solution

S = 4
M = x
DS = x + 4
US = x – 4
6/(x + 4) + 6/(x – 4) = 2
x = 8

7. In how much time would the simple interest on a certain sum be 0.125 times the principal at 10% per annum?

    1 1/4 years
    1 3/4 years
    2 1/4 years
    2 3/4 years

Answer: Option 1

Solution

et sum = x. Then, S.I. = 0.125x = 1/8 x, R = 10%

Time = (100 * x) / (x * 8 * 10) = 5/4 = 1 1/4 years.

8. Find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 28 m at the rate of Rs.1.50 a meter?

    Rs.150
    Rs.132
    Rs.100
    Rs.125

Answer: Option 2

Solution

2 * 22/7 * 14 = 88

88 * 1 1/2 = Rs.132

9. A pupil’s marks were wrongly entered as 83 instead of 63. Due to the average marks for the class got increased by half. The number of pupils in the class is?

    10
    20
    40
    73

Answer: Option 3

Solution

Let there be x pupils in the class.

Total increase in marks = (x * 1/2) = x/2
x/2 = (83 – 63) => x/2 = 20 => x = 40.

10. The H.C.F of two numbers is 11 and their L.C.M is 7700. If one of the numbers is 275, then the other is?

    279
    283
    308
    318

Answer: Option 3

Solution

Other number = (11 * 7700)/275 = 308.

11. If the sum of the two numbers is 22 and the sum of their squares is 404, then the product of the numbers is?

    40
    44
    80
    88

Answer: Option 1

Solution

Let the numbers be x and y.

Then, (x + y) = 22 and x2 + y2 = 404
Now,
2xy = (x + y)2 – (x2 + y2)
2xy= 222 – 404 = 484 – 404 = 80
xy = 40

12. Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank from empty to full in 30 minutes, 20 minutes and 10 minutes respectively. When the tank is empty, all the three pipes are opened. A, B and C discharge chemical solutions P, Q and R respectively. What is the proportion of solution R in the liquid in the tank after 3 minutes?

    5/11
    6/11
    7/11
    8/11

Answer: Option 2

Solution

Part filled by (A + B + C) in 3 minutes = 3(1/30 + 1/20 + 1/10) = 11/20

Part filled by C in 3 minutes = 3/10
Required ratio = 3/10 * 20/11 = 6/11

13. The principle that amounts to Rs. 4913 in 3 years at 6 1/4 % per annum C.I. compounded annually, is?

    Rs. 3096
    Rs. 4076
    Rs. 4085
    Rs. 4096

Answer: Option 4

Solution

Principal = [4913 / (1 + 25/(4 * 100))3]

= 4913 * 16/17 * 16/17 * 16/17 = Rs. 4096.

14. If the height of a cone is increased by 100% then its volume is increased by?

16. A sells a bicycle to B at a profit of 20%. B sells it to C at a profit of 25%. If C pays Rs. 225 for it, the cost price of the bicycle for A is?

    Rs. 110
    Rs. 120
    Rs. 125
    Rs. 150

Answer: Option 4

Solution:

125% of 120% of A = 225

125/100 * 120/100 * A = 225
A = 225 * 2/3 = 150.

17. A person’s present age is two-fifths of the age of his mother. After 8 years, he will be one-half of the age of his mother. How old id the mother at present?

    32 years
    36 years
    40 years
    48 years

Answer: Option 3

Solution

Let the mother’s present age be x years. Then, the person’s present age = 2/5 x years.

(2/5 x + 8) = 1/2 (x + 8)
2(2x + 40) = 5(x + 8) => x = 40

18. In an election between two candidates A and B, the number of valid votes received by A exceeds those received by B by 15% of the total number of votes polled. If 20% of the votes polled were invalid and a total of 8720 votes were polled, then how many valid votes did B get?

    2160
    2420
    2834
    3150
    None of these

Answer: Option 3

Solution

Let the total number of votes polled in the election be 100k.

Number of valid votes = 100k – 20% (100k) = 80k
Let the number of votes polled in favour of A and B be a and b respectively.
a – b = 15% (100k) => a = b + 15k
=> a + b = b + 15k + b
Now, 2b + 15k = 80k and hence b = 32.5k
It is given that 100k = 8720
32.5k = 32.5k/100k * 8720 = 2834
The number of valid votes polled in favour of B is 2834.

19. The cost of 16 pens and 8 pencils is Rs.352 and the cost of 4 pens and 4 pencils is Rs.96. Find the cost of each pen?

    Rs.32
    Rs.28
    Rs.36
    Rs.25
    None of these

Answer: Option 5

Solution

Let the cost of each pen and pencil be ‘p’ and ‘q’ respectively.

16p + 8q = 352 — (1)
4p + 4q = 96
8p + 8q = 192 — (2)
(1) – (2) => 8p = 160
=> p = 20

20. I. a2 + 11a + 30 = 0,

      II. b2 + 6b + 5 = 0 to solve both the equations to find the values of a and b?

    If a < b
    If a = b
    If the relationship between a and b cannot be established
    If a > b E. If a = b

Answer: Option 2

Solution

I. (a + 6)(a + 5) = 0

=> a = -6, -5
II. (b + 5)(b + 1) = 0
=> b = -5, -1 => a = b

21. 32% of 425 – ?% of 250 = 36

    20
    40
    60
    80 E. 70

Answer: Option 2

Solution

32/100 * 425 – x/100 * 250 = 36

 => x/100 * 250 = 136 – 36 = 100
=> x = (100 * 100)/250 = 40

22. The radius of a wheel is 22.4 cm. What is the distance covered by the wheel in making 500 resolutions?

    252 m
    704 m
    352 m
    808 m
    None of these

Answer: Option 2

Solution

In one resolution, the distance covered by the wheel is its own circumference. Distance covered in 500 resolutions.

= 500 * 2 * 22/7 * 22.4 = 70400 cm = 704 m
