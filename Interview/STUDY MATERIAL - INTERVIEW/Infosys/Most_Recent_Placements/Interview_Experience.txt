I was in Galgotias College.

Infosys had visited our campus for ‚ÄúSystems Engineer‚Äù post. On 21st of September, we had our written paper round. It consisted of 3 sections:

1. Arithmetic reasoning and analytical thinking.
2. Mathematical critical thinking and logical reasoning.
3. Test of communicative English.

The first section contained a total of 15 questions that had to be solved in 35 mins. 5 questions were on Syllogisms (confusing syllogism actually), 5 on Data Interpretation (very easy) and 5 on data sufficiency (moderate). Enough time to solve all the question!

The second section was tough. We had to solve 15 questions in 25 mins. Questions were Easy But time consuming, try to manage your time more and more in this section!

The third section was easier. It consisted of 40 questions to be solved in 35 mins. There were 2 paragraphs, fill in the blanks, theme detection, choose the correct options type of questions. My advice is to ‚ÄúMake your tenses clear for this round‚Äù.

This is how my interview actually went facing an old age, humble and kind HR:

I opened the door and asked. Sir may I come in?
