I'm from ITM, Gwalior.

Infosys came to our college in the last week of September. First we had to take an online test of aptitude, reasoning and English.

For aptitude, focus more on time and work, speed, time and distance, crypt arithmetic as these are some topics which have a probability of 100%.

For reasoning, focus on seating arrangement, syllogism, data sufficiency, data interpretation as these will come 100%.

For English, practice RC's, sentence correction, critical thinking and replacements.

Reasoning is the toughest.

After clearing the first round, we had our interview round, it was pretty easy. They only focus on the things written in your resume so be confident with it.

I've been placed in three companies which are Infosys, Wipro and TCS.
