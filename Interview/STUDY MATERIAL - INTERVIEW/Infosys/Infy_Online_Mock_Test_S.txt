Now what I suggest is first you go through all txt files.
(And I have attached question folders which you may like to refer)

Prepare those questions then try how much you learn / how much you understood by the following links.
When you are practicing at home you don't keep record of time, you are taking for each question to solve. These sites will do this for you. So that the worst case of knowing everything, able to solve everything but shortage of time will not happen in your case.
